# Wildfires-Prediction-Using-Remote-Sensing-Data-and-Machine-Learning:
The Dataset was created based on Remote Sensing data to predict the occurrence of wildfires, it contains Data related to the state of crops (NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), meteorological conditions (LST: Land Surface Temperature) as well as the fire indicator “Thermal Anomalies”. All three parameters were collected from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), an instrument carried on board the Terra platform. The collected data went through several preprocessing techniques using Google Earth Engine before building the final Dataset. The experimental Dataset is considered as a case study to illustrate what can be done at larger scales.
